Every day, over 164 million hours of videos are watched on Netflix globally.
That is just one of the multiple video streaming services available in the mar-
ket, and new entrants are still coming up. Even though the majority of these
are Millennial and Gen-Z user, these services are equally famous among other
generations. Considering this range of users, and the plethora of content avail-
able on these platforms, it has become imperative for these services to make it
easier for the users to navigate these platforms and find content most suited to
their individual taste. This still remains a key challenge as on average, Ameri-
can adults take 7.4 minutes to decide what to watch on a streaming service.

One of the most used feature while choosing video content is the genre. As such,
it is important to ensure that the correct genres are assigned to a video. In this
project, we aim to contribute to this task by training a model which takes the
name and plot of a video as an input and then predicts the genres which seem
relevant to that plot. Since a video can fall in more than one genre, we create
a multi-label classification solution. We train this model on data available on
the IMDb platform, which is considered as one of the best source of informa-
tion related to films, television series, home videos, video games, and streaming
content online.
